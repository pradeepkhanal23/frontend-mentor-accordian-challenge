# FAQ Accordion Card

Welcome to the FAQ Accordion Card project! This project was created as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge and served as an early learning experience. It showcases the use of CSS checkbox trick to show and hide the questions and answers in an accordion-style layout. Not using JavaScript is the main feature of this project, making it a unique challenge.

## Challenge Details

This project is based on the [Frontend Mentor Accordion Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). The goal was to create an accordion component without using JavaScript, solely relying on CSS and the checkbox trick for interactivity.

## Note
